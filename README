airconf is a tool for configuring the the Access Control Lists in
several Apple Airport Base Stations at once. Today it supports only
Base Station 1 (Graphite) based on Karl Bridge. Base Station 2 (White)
is a completely different beast and based on VxWorks.

airconf is also a Python framework for detecting Apple Airport Base
Stations (White and Graphite), reading, printing and changing their
configurtation (only Graphite).

airconf has been tested under different dialects of Unix and Python
2.2 but should also work with Python 2.x, MacOS 9 and Windows.

airconf uses pysnmp a pure Python module which can be found at
http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/ To install it type something like this:

wget http://download.sourceforge.net/pysnmp/pysnmp-1.6.5.tar.gz
tar xzvf pysnmp-1.6.5.tar.gz
cd pysnmp-1.6.5
python setup.py install

To use airport_aclupdate to update several Airport Basestation Access
control lists at once copy type following commands:

install -c -m 755 -d airport_aclupdate /usr/local/bin
install -c -m 600 -d airport.acl /usr/local/etc
install -c -m 600 -d airport.bases /usr/local/etc
python setup.py install
rehash

If you like different Directories you have to edit 'etcdir' at the
beginning of airport_aclupdate. Edit /usr/local/etc/airport.bases to
contain the IP addresses and passwords/community strings of all the
Basestations you like to update. Edit /usr/local/etc/airport.acl to
contain a list of all MAC addresses which should be allowed to access
the Wireless network. After each MAC address you can add up to 19
characters of description. Call airport_aclupdate and watch it
updating and rebooting your Bases. 

Call 'python airport_detect.py <broadcast>' to get a list of airport
base stations in a certain subnet.

If you want to use the python module read the output of 
'pydoc -w airport'.

This tool builds on Work by Bill Fenner, Jonathan Sevy and Rop
Gonggrijp.
