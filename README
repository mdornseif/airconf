airconf is a tool for configuring the the Access Control Lists in
several Apple Airport Base Stations at once. Today it supports only
Base Station 1 (Graphite) based on Karl Bridge. Base Station 2 (White)
is a completely different beast and based on VxWorks.

airconf is also a Python framework for detecting Apple Airport Base
Stations (White and Graphite), reading, printing and changing their
configurtation (only Graphite).

base stations in a certain subnet.
